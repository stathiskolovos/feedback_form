# Lab: Create Feedback Form for Survey

In this lab, you will create a feedback form using React functional components and manage user details using the useState hook. You will implement event handlers to manage form input changes, validate user inputs, and handle form submissions. Additionally, you will create a confirmation dialog using the confirm method to confirm user details before final submission. Upon successful submission, you will reset the form fields and display a thank you message to the user. This lab will give you practical experience building interactive forms and handling user inputs in React applications.

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Create a form to collect user feedback, including their name, email, and the feedback message.
2. Handle form submission, including data validation, to ensure that the users enter their names and provide feedback before submitting the form.
3. Display a confirmation dialog to users after they submit their feedback, showing the information they entered and prompting them to confirm before final submission.
4. Reset the form fields to clear the input values and provide users with a clean form for submitting additional feedback.
